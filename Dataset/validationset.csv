Thankfully the weather was warm, maybe even a bit too warm and the course was really familiar to me. ✔️After a light warmup I lined up with the 57:30 pacers and was ready for the race. The sun was shining and I was feeling quite thirsty on the starting line. I figured that it was just the nerves and didn't think much of it at that time. The race started and I managed to keep a good even pace of 5:40 - 5:45 min/km for the first 5 km. ✔️At the start of 6 km my lower back started to ache and it affected by breathing rhythm. Luckily I was able to stretch my back while running and was able to continue but at the same time it meant that I slowed down to around 6 min/km pace for the kilometers 7 to 9. I picked up the pace on the final kilometer and crossed the finish line in 58:46. ✔️For the upcoming races I have to take a closer look at my fluid intake to make minimize the possibility of cramps or aches along the way. All in all Helsinki 10 was a well organized race with a fast route. I'll be on the starting line next year, that's for sure! 🔙Jaakko\n\n#werunhelsinki #hhm2019 #helsinkihalfmarathon #helsinkihalfmarathon #ambassador #lähettiläs\n"", 'Tänään 🐰hommissa ennen varsinaista koitosta Helsinki half marathonilla kesäkuussa.

figured that it was just the nerves and didnt think much of it at that time the race started and i managed to keep a good even pace of 540 545 minkm for the first 5 km at the start of 6 km my lower back started to ache and it affected by breathing rhythm luckily i was able to stretch my back while running and was able to continue but at the same time it meant that i slowed down to around 6 minkm pace for the kilometers 7 to 9 i picked up the pace on the final kilometer and crossed the finish line in 5846 for the upcoming races i have to take a closer look at my fluid intake to make minimize

A friend of his was redesigning a huge building in a small town and wanted to turn it into a collection of shops designed by different creators. He wanted Derrick to dream big and design a bookstore.\n\nDerrick told me his plan for Fascination Station. It was to be a train station, with a checkout counter modeled after Grand Central stations information kiosk. It would have cubby holes for reading, set into in the back wall designed like bunks on a train car. Large displays would be inset in arches showing landscapes rolling by. Travel posters advertising departure times for famous fictional destinations would hang on one wall, and shelves would roll away, so folding chairs could pull out from a secret compartment and an audience could watch authors read from the back of a full size caboose, as if they were on a whistle-stop tour.\n\nIt sounded wonderful, and Derrick wanted me to draw it.\n\nWhile I make detailed 3D models for my comics, I’d never designed something like this. Something that was to become an actual physical place. Something that needed to fit in exact dimensions and be usable by flesh and blood people. It was a heck of a lot of fun, and the illustration came together in no time.\n\nFascination Station Book Store overhead view\nAn overhead view of Fascination Station – a Write Bloody Bookstore\nSadly, things fell through.

would be inset in arches showing landscapes rolling by travel posters advertising departure times for famous fictional destinations would hang on one wall and shelves would roll away so folding chairs could pull out from a secret compartment and an audience could watch authors read from the back of a full size caboose as if they were on a whistlestop tour it sounded wonderful and derrick wanted me to draw it while i make detailed 3d models for my comics id never designed something like this something that was to become an actual physical place something that needed to fit in exact dimensions
